#R29. use pure member to replace set/get
use @property to define special behavior

class Homework(object):
   @property
   def grade(self):
       return self._grade
   
   @grade.setter
   def grade(self, value):
   if not (0 <= value <= 100):
       raise ValueError('Grade must be between 0 and 100')
   self._grade = value
   
#R30. use property to add more functionalities to the class members

#R31. use descriptor to rewrite the @property method when the method needs to be reused
之类无法重用父类的property『属性』
see the code

#R32. use __gettattr__, getattribute__, __setattr__ implement required attributes
__getattr__ will be triggerred if there is no such attribute exists. 
in DB transaction, we still cannot use it to validate if the current transaction is still open or not.
it is because __getattr__ return the value from current class dict.
In order to do this, we need to use __getattribute__

#R33. use meta class to validate its child classes
see the code

#R34. use meta class to register its child classes
see the code

#R35. use meta class to annotate class attributes
define the child class attributes before child class is defined
